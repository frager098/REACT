# Why do we need REACT?
1 React have a virtual DOM that supports declarative programming which enables    developers to make dynamic applications and make changes in the DOM easily.

2 React helps developers to make complex and single page applications that give a seamless and smooth experience to users.

3 React has a component based architecture. Small, reusable components are made to develop the whole web app. Each component is responsible for its UI and logic. It avoids code duplication.
